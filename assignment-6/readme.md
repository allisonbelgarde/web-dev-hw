#This is my technical report for assignment 6.

I did the 90's design. I styled my page after the layout of 90's webpages.
Kinda blocky but central and linear. And with obnoxious colors of course.

My color palette was Magenta (#FF00FF), Blue (#0000FF), and Yellow (#FFFF00).

This bit was somewhat tricky for me. I wasn't sure how to incorporate the images
or overlay them. But I found a design that I was happy with in the end.
