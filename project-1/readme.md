# Technical Report Project 1

I  use Chrome to surf the web. I learned that this is currently the most common
used browser currently. It automatically updates flash plugins to be the most
up to date.

In the Wayback Machine I looked at Google. It was interesting to see that in 2000
it looked basically the same as it does now, white background with the logo. The
logo has slightly change and I'm sure I remember the search box not having
autocomplete during this time.

During this work cycle I ultilized the issues board, only to find that I had
fixed my issue! But it was valuable to learn how to use the board and to know
that help is avaliable always.
