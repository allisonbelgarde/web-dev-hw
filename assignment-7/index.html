<div class="act">
<p>ACT I</p>
<p>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</p></div>
<br>
    <div class="directions">
    <p>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO<br></p></div>
<br>
<div class="speaker">
<p>ANTONIO<br></p></div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<br>
    It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br>
    But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br>
    What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<br>
    I am to learn;<br>
    And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br>
    That I have much ado to know myself.<br> </p></div>
<br>
<div class="speaker">
<p>SALARINO<br></p></div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br>
    There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br>
    Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br>
    Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<br>
    Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br>
    That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br>
    As they fly by them with their woven wings.<br> </p></div>
<br>
<div class="speaker">
<p>SALANIO<br></p></div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br>
    The better part of my affections would<br>
    Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br>
    Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<br>
    Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br>
    And every object that might make me fear<br>
    Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br>
    Would make me sad.<br> </p></div>
<br>
<div class="speaker">
<p>SALARINO<br></p></div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>My wind cooling my broth<br>
    Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br>
    What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br>
    I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br>
    But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br>
    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br>
    Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<br>
    To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>
    And see the holy edifice of stone,<br>
    And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>
    Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br>
    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>
    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>
    And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br>
    And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>
    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>
    That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br>
    But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br>
    Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br></p></div>
<br>
<div class="speaker">
<p>ANTONIO<br></p></div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br>
    My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br>
    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br>
    Upon the fortune of this present year:<br>
    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.<br></p></div>
<br>
<div class="speaker">
<p>SALARINO<br></p></div>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Why, then you are in love.<br></p></div>
