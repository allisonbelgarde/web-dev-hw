<h1>About the Author</h1>

<p>I chose to give instructions on how to make peanut butter sandwiches because it is
  something I know how to do very well and it truly is and has been a staple of my life.
  Without being too much of a sob story, my family was very poor when I was a child
  and we often ate peanut butter and jelly for meals. Even as our situation improved,
  I would return to peanut butter and jelly for its simplicity and tastiness. For
  being a poor man's food, it is rather delicious.</p>

  <p> I also thought to make this instructable because when I searched for instructions
    on this topic, every instructable seems to be a joke. How can I go on when
    sources like YouTube channel How To Basic is creating videos like the one below: </p>

    <p>If you are making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich this way, please stop.
      Think of the children.</p>

    <p>I will also include on this page a map to a place you can buy all the ingredients
      for this instructable, a place called Walmart. In case one does not know where you can buy groceries. </p>
