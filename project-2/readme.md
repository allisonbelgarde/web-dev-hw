##This is my project 2 technical report

Learning HTML has been very interesting to me overall. It was especially intersting to learn about iframes and how to put them in.

What I'm excited to learn about is how to make the font on the website have different styles.

This work cycle was intimidating building a website from the ground up by myself with some instruction. But it turned out to be very fun in the end being able to create something of my own.
